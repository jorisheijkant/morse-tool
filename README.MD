# Morse tool
A simple tool to work with morse files. 

# Installation
This tool uses a few packages, that can be installed using pip, with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. N.B.: the packages require Python 3.10 as a specific version. It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to work with this tool, so you don't need to downgrade.
